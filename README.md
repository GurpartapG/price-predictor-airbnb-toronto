# 🧠 Toronto Airbnb Price Predictor (Work in Progress)

Welcome to an upcoming project where I’ll be building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict nightly Airbnb rental prices in Toronto.

This project will:
- Analyze 20,000+ listings from the InsideAirbnb dataset 📊
- Engineer relevant features from host, location, and listing data 🏙️
- Train multiple regression models, including XGBoost, to accurately estimate prices 💡
- Focus on explainability and deployability for real-world usage 🚀

🔧 **Tech Stack**
Python | Pandas | Scikit-Learn | XGBoost | Jupyter | Matplotlib

📌 **Goals**
- Build a high-performance, interpretable model
- Visualize price drivers like location, host activity, and availability
- Potentially integrate with Streamlit and SHAP

📈 Future Work / Next Steps
- Integrate the model into a Streamlit app for interactive predictions
- Use SHAP for better model interpretability
- Explore a secondary ML model to forecast listing availability
- Visualize neighborhood-level pricing trends with map overlays


Stay tuned for updates as this project develops!
